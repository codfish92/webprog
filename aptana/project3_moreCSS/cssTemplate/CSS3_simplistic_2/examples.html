        <h1>Examples</h1>
        <p>This page contains examples of all important features of SHORYUKENS!!!!</p>
        <h2>It makes the opponent airborne and puts them into a knockdown state:</h2>
          <p>This is an important feature of the shoryuken, and it isn't even the primary one! An airborne target is unable to block, tech, and is going to be in a very predictable place. This allows you to juggle them with more moves if your character posseses them.</p>
          <p>For example, in Street fighter 4, if Ryu performs a Shoryuken on a jumping target, he can then juggle them with a hadouken, a super, and even his ultra for free damage. This can also be preformed on grounded opponents, but the positioning has to be very precise and must be done with a strong Shoryuken. </p>
          <p>Being put into a knockdown state is also bad news for your opponent. It gives you a varity of mix up options.</p>
          <p>For example, in Street Fighter 2, Ken can shoryuken an opponent, and then procedue to attempt a cross up with his jumping roundhouse, or go for a frame trap with a forward low kick for another combo or go for a grab. If your opponent has to guess what your going to do, making it game of rock-paper-scissors where if you lose, your attack is only blocked or teched, while if your opponent loses, they get big damage dealt to them.</p>
        <h2>It has Invincibilty frames:</h2>
          <p>All Shoryukens(including Dan's) all posses invincibilty frames. This means that there are frames during the move where you will have no hurtbox and an active hitbox. No matter how powerful the move is, it <strong>WILL</strong> be beaten by a shoryuken. This means that a shoryuken can also be used to beat out a lot frame traps, and is great to execute as a reversal. This is what makes the shoryuken a shoryuken.</p>
          <p>For example, if Ryu gets knocked down by Bison, he can do a shoryuken on getup to beat bison's headstomp crossup and jumping fierce. This means that ryu effecively can beat out many of bison's mixups limiting him to throws, which isn't hard to stop.</p>
        
      
        <h2>Jargon</h2>
        <p>You may not understand anything just said in the examples becuase of jargon. This table should help with that.</p>
        <table style="width:100%; border-spacing:0;">
          <tr><th>Term</th><th>Description</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Tech</td><td>Breaking a throw, or rolling off the ground quickly, or absorbing a wall bounce.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Juggle</td><td>Attacks done on an airborne target that result in them remaining airborne.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Mix-up</td><td>A state when you have many attack options at your disposale that allow you to hit your opponent whether they're jumping, guarding and or crouching, resulting in your opponent having to guess what your doing.</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Cross-up</td><td>Because blocking is done by holding away from your opponent, if you cross the horizontal plane of your opponent you have to hold the other direction. A cross up is an attack that is difficult to tell which direction you have to hold to block it because it is performed either just before crossing the plane or right after it.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Frame-trap</td><td>A situtation where your opponent is forced to do an animation that they cannot be hit in(commonly a get up animation), and performing a move during this such that the hitbox of it is already active when they can finally get hit. Blocking these moves is difficult, and only a reversal attack with invincibilty frames can counter this.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Hurtbox</td><td>The physical box or area that an attack must be in to hurt you.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Hitbox</td><td>The active area of your attack. If your hitbox collides with your opponents hurtbox, you will do damage to them. Most hitboxs are also extensions of your hurtbox(if you try to kick me, i can hit your leg with my fist and do damage to you or trade blows), though the hitbox tends to extend a little past the hurtbox. A hitbox is said to be disjoint if it is connected to the character, but not attached to their hurtbox.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Disjoint hitbox</td><td>Describes a move that is not attached to a charcters hurtbox, but will be deactived if the character is interupted in some way. A good example of this is marth's sword in super smash brothers brawl. You cannot attack marth's sword to hurt him, but if you intrrupt his attack in someway, the hitbox immediatly disapears.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Projectile</td><td>A move that is not attached to characters hurtbox and is NOT deactived if the character is interrupted. Think hadouken. I can throw one out, get hit, and the hadouken will still fly accross the screen, and deal damage if it collides with an opponents hurtbox.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Reversal</td><td>Doing a move the very first frame you can after a forced animation(usually a get up).</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Trade-blows</td><td>When two opponents hit each other at the same time.</td></tr>
