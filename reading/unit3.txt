1.Normal flow is the browser executing line by line. ie, if you put a div1 class, and before the closing tags put a div2 class, it will draw div2 inside div1. If the closing tags for div1 appeared before div2, then div2 would be drawn outside div1 and below it. 
2. you specifiy the width of a float element to let the browser know that this element must be this big, as most do not have an implict width. 
3. The clear property is used to make a float stop being a float. This will allow background colors and other formats to apply to the float. 
4. the overflow property works by detecting if the content of the element would extend beyond its boundries and handle it in various ways. it also clears a float in the process, so it can be used to clear floats as well. ie. using overflow: scroll will make the webpage add scroll bars to the element to allow users to see the content if the webpage gets too small.
5. The order does matter when styling pseudo classes. for instance, trying to style link, foucus, then visited will cause problems. ordering in link, visted, focus will work.
6. static renders in normal flow, this is implied. relative applies position bassed on where it would normally render. ie if I had a box in a content area, i could use position: relative; left 50px to have this box be rendered 50 px to the left of its normal area. Absolute is in refrence to the container. numerics change slightly when using this positioning, for instance left: 200px does not mean 200 px to the left, it mean 200px from the left
